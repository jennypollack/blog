This is my first post using jekyll.

(9/30/15) I made this <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/04/crispy-potato-and-chorizo-hash-recipe.html" target="_blank">chorizo hash</a> from Serious Eats and it was delicious. I didn't add the eggs on the first go around but I really wish I did. I did add broccoli and topped it off with some Frank's Red Hot.
10/10 would make again.
